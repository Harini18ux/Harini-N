EduTutor_AIPersonalized Learning Powered by IBM Watsonx and Generative AI📌 Project OverviewEduTutor_AI is an innovative project that leverages the power of IBM Watsonx AI's Granite-13B Instruct-v2 model to provide personalized learning experiences. By generating human-like responses to user prompts, this project aims to enhance education through adaptive and intelligent tutoring tailored to individual needs.🛠 Tools & TechnologiesIBM Cloud Pak for Data: Infrastructure for managing and deploying AI models.IBM Watsonx.ai: Platform for building and scaling AI solutions.IBM Granite-13B Instruct-v2 Model: Advanced generative AI model for creating human-like responses.Python: Core programming language for development.Jupyter Notebook / IBM Watson Studio: Environment for model development and experimentation.🚀 FeaturesGenerates personalized educational content based on user prompts.Utilizes state-of-the-art generative AI for natural and engaging responses.Scalable and deployable on IBM Cloud for real-world applications.🧑‍🏫 Sample Use CasePrompt: "Explain the concept of photosynthesis in simple terms for a 5th-grade student."
Output: The model generates a clear, age-appropriate explanation, such as:
"Photosynthesis is like a superpower that plants have! They use sunlight, water, and air to make their own food, which helps them grow. It also creates oxygen, which we breathe!"📋 PrerequisitesIBM Cloud account with access to Watsonx.ai.Python 3.8+ installed.Familiarity with Jupyter Notebook or IBM Watson Studio.Required Python libraries: ibm-watsonx-ai, pandas, numpy.🛠 Setup InstructionsClone the Repository:git clone https://github.com/your-userna
